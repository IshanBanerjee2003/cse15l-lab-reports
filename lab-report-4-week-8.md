# LAB REPORT 3 :

In this post, I am going to create another page in my lab report repository, like I did for lab report 1, 2, and 3 respectively, and write my report here.

For each snippet, I have added a test both to my implementation of markdown-parse, and the implementation that we as a group reviewed reviewed.

The link to the markdown-parse repository which we reviewed can be accessed through [the following link](https://github.com/johnsonli010801/markdown-parse)
